    <p>I woke up to find the entitled error in the <code>rsnapshot</code> logs on one of my machines, which occurred as it was trying to remotely backup, via SSH, another.  A quick search and reading through a number of threads revealed <a href="http://monkey.org/openbsd/archive/misc/0207/msg02592.html">this message</a> stating that this problem was encountered with a Linksys router involved.  Lo and behold, my home network was just switched to a Linksys BEFSR41 when the problem began.</p>

<p>I think the router may also be the culprit for the occasional &ldquo;error establishing encrypted connection code -12192&rdquo; that Firefox has been giving me since the switch.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Dec  1, 2007</div>
    <p>After reading <a href="http://antoniocangiano.com/2007/11/28/holy-shmoly-ruby-19-smokes-python-away/">this article</a> comparing the new Ruby 1.9 to it&rsquo;s older version and Python, I thought it would be interesting to see how my preferred language, Perl, compares.  First, because my hardware is certainly different from the author of that post, I re-ran the Python and Ruby 1.9 tests:</p>

<pre>
Python:
real    0m43.415s
user    0m41.455s
sys     0m0.132s

Ruby:
real    0m35.379s
user    0m33.722s
sys     0m0.112s
</pre>

<p>I threw together some quick Perl:</p>

<pre class="brush: ruby;">
sub fib {
    my $n = shift;

    if ( $n == 0 or $n == 1 ) {
        return $n;
    } else {
        return fib($n - 1) + fib($n - 2);
    }
}

for (0..35) {
    print "n=$_ => " . fib($_) . "\n";
}
</pre>

<p>and ran it:</p>

<pre>
Perl:
real    1m15.329s
user    1m9.188s
sys     0m0.364s
</pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s impressive; Perl sucks at this recursive implementation of computing Fibonacci numbers.  Since I had the makings of a little suite of benchmarks, I implemented this test in C and Java:</p>

<p>C code:
<pre class="brush: cpp;"></p>

<h1>include <stdio.h></h1>

<p>int fib(int n) {
    if ( (n == 0) || (n == 1) )
        return n;
    else
        return (fib(n-1) + fib(n-2));
} //fib</p>

<p>int main() {
    int x;
    for (x = 0; x &lt; 36; x++) {
        printf( &quot;n = %d =&gt; %d\n&quot;, x, fib(x) );
    } //for</p>
<div class="highlight plaintext"><table style="border-spacing: 0"><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl" style="text-align: right"><pre class="lineno">1</pre></td><td class="code"><pre>return 0;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>

<p>}
</pre></p>

<p>C timing:
<pre>
real    0m0.605s
user    0m0.564s
sys     0m0.000s
</pre></p>

<p>Java code:
<pre class="brush: java;">
class Fib {
    static int fib(int n) {
        if ( (n == 0) || (n == 1) )
            return n;
        else
            return (fib(n-1) + fib(n-2));
    } //fib</p>
<div class="highlight plaintext"><table style="border-spacing: 0"><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl" style="text-align: right"><pre class="lineno">1
2
3
4
5</pre></td><td class="code"><pre>public static void main(String args[]) {
    for (int x = 0; x &lt; 36; x++) {
        System.out.println( "n = " + x + " =&gt; " + fib(x) );
    } //for
} //main
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>

<p>} //Fib
</pre></p>

<p>Java timing:
<pre>
real    0m0.455s
user    0m0.412s
sys     0m0.012s
</pre></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting to see the huge speed disparities in these languages, but remember, this was a single, very limited test; don&rsquo;t take these benchmarks as having any significant meaning.  Really, don&rsquo;t take them to mean much of anything, unless all you do is write lots of simple recursive code.</p>

    <p>Python can&rsquo;t deal with empty code blocks, which may arise if you want to stub out a block but leave the implementation for later.  If you have one in your code, the interpreter will give the following error:</p>

<pre class="brush: python;">
  File "foo.py", line 1
    if (foo == bar):
     ^
IndentationError: expected an indented block
</pre>

<p>In this case, you can use the <code>pass</code> operator which will do nothing but take up a line, resulting in the following code:</p>

<pre class="brush: python;">
if (foo == bar):
    pass #TODO
else:
    print "nothing to do!"

    <div class="article-title-date">Nov 28, 2007</div>
    <p>A server of mine, Claudius, sent me a very polite, though unpleasant email early this morning
<pre>
from:       mdadm monitoring <a href="mailto:root@dinomite.net">root@dinomite.net</a>
to:         root@dinomite.net,
date:       Nov 28, 2007 6:25 AM
subject:    Fail event on /dev/md0:claudius</p>

<p>This is an automatically generated mail message from mdadm
running on claudius</p>

<p>A Fail event had been detected on md device /dev/md0.</p>

<p>Faithfully yours, etc.
</pre></p>

<p>Ugh; that means one of the drives in RAID set on Claudius has failed.  I only run <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID#Standard_levels">RAID0</a> on the machine, so data loss isn&rsquo;t any issue unless the second drive gives up, too.  I try not to actively administer machines; I just get them setup in a solid state and then make use of them, no reason to waste time fiddling around.  I hadn&rsquo;t done anything of note with the machine in question in some time, so I wasn&rsquo;t even sure what the drive setup was, though <code>df</code> clears that up:</p>

<pre>
claudius:/home/dinomite/public_html# df -h
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/md0              5.5G  1.7G  3.6G  32% /

</pre>

<p>So, md0 is the root (/) filesystem and Claudius also has a second RAID device, md1, which supports the <code>/home</code> filesystem.  I used <code>mdadm --detail</code> to get some more information about <code>md0</code>:</p>

<pre>

/dev/md0:

       2       3        1        -      faulty   /dev/hda1
</pre>

<p>So it thinks there&rsquo;s a problem with <code>/dev/hda1</code>, one of the two partitions that makes up this RAID device.  At this point, I recall that Claudius has three disks in it, a 20G (/backup) and two 80G, the latter two support both of the systems RAID devices, <code>md0</code> and <code>md1</code>.  The notice that mdadm sent me was only concerning <code>md0</code> which is odd, because <code>md1</code> spans both of those physical disks as well:</p>

<pre>

       1       3       66        1      active sync   /dev/hdb2
</pre>

<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t show any problems.  What does this mean?  Well, I&rsquo;m not exactly sure, but it does mean that the disk <code>/dev/hda</code> which holds the failed partition (<code>hda1</code>) of <code>md0</code> isn&rsquo;t completely bad; it&rsquo;s still spinning away and working.  That probably means that the filesystem on <code>hda1</code> somehow got muddled up or that there&rsquo;s a physical error on the portion of the disk support <code>hda1</code>.  Either way, the first step for me is to simly rebuild the array as it was before.  This is as simple as removing the faulty partition and adding it back to the array:</p>

<pre>
claudius:/home/dinomite/public_html# mdadm /dev/md0 -r /dev/hda1
mdadm: hot removed /dev/hda1
claudius:/home/dinomite/public_html# mdadm /dev/md0 -a /dev/hda1
mdadm: hot added /dev/hda1
</pre>

<p>The RAID device will automatically begin rebuilding this partition and keep you informed of the status.</p>

</pre>

<p>Though a failed RAID device isn&rsquo;t the best way to start your morning, managing them in Linux is a fairly straightforward operation.  If the device actually had been bad, I would simply have to shut down the machine, replace the bad drive, partition it like the other one (<code>fdisk -l</code> helps) and then add it to the array as shown above.  In most cases, this wouldn&rsquo;t be much harder than what I had to do, though my case the server is a few hundred miles away, so that&rsquo;d be quite a hike.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Nov 26, 2007</div>
    <p>There are literally hundreds of lists of the best Firefox extensions yet <a href="http://db.rambleschmack.net/pc_tips/best_firefox_extensions">few</a> mention what I deem to be the most important: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1859">Tab History</a>.  A feature that I first became addicted to in <a href="http://galeon.sourceforge.net">Galeon</a>, Tab History causes newly created tabs created by middle-clicking a link or clicking &ldquo;Open Link in New Tab&rdquo; to inherit the history of their parent.</p>

<p>That is, I can run a search, open a whole bunch of the windows in tabs and then close the windows with reckless abandon once I decide one of the tabs fulfills my needs.  Later, if I find that the tab I&rsquo;m reading doesn&rsquo;t have the information I was searching for, I don&rsquo;t need to ctrl+shift+t and sift through the tabs that I had prematurely closed searching for the web search that I had run.  Instead, because the tab in question was spawned from said search, I simply hit &lsquo;back&rsquo; and head right back to the original page.</p>

<p>Similarly, if I&rsquo;m reading an article opening links in new tabs as I go, I will usually close that article&rsquo;s tab before perusing the links that it contained.  If I happen upon one of those new tabs and have forgotten what the context for it was in the article, I can simply hit the back button to find the answer.</p>

<p>Tab History really is the most important Firefox extension to me.</p>

Morgan Webb made a comparison between Amazon&rsquo;s new <a href="http://amazon.com/gp/product/B000FI73MA/sr=53-1/qid=1195527445/ref=tr_359161">Kindle</a> eBook reader and a hardcover book.  Though she was simply trying to liken the Kindle to the nearest priced physical book product, this is a false comparison.  Someone buying a hardcover book is looking for something more than just the words and content of the story; they enjoy the physical representation of a fine work.  A more accurate comparison for the Kindle is a regular old paperback, whose purchaser is simply looking for the cheapest representation of the book&rsquo;s content.  At less than $15 for the average paperback, the Kindle doesn&rsquo;t look like such a good deal, since they charge $10 per book for the $400 device.</p>

    <h1 class="article-title"><a href="/blog/2007/11/15/time-machine-for-linux/">Time Machine for Linux</a></h1>
    <div class="article-title-date">Nov 15, 2007</div>
    <p>Since Apple&rsquo;s recent release of Leopard, which comes with the wonderful backup solution <em>Time Machine</em>, I&rsquo;ve seen more than a few articles explaining how those with Linux/Unix machines can create there own incremental backups using <code>rsync</code>.  This is great and, short of hard-linked directories, exactly like Apple&rsquo;s <em>Time Machine</em> backend.  Furthermore, this has always been possible on systems with <code>rsync</code> available and filesystems that support hardlinks.  I&rsquo;ve been doing incremental backups for years but, unlike all of the recent articles in question, I didn&rsquo;t roll my own solution: I use &lsquo;rsnapshot&rsquo; to do all of the hard work for me.</p>

<p>There are a <a href="http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/217">number</a> of <a href="www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots/">tutorials</a> for setting up <code>rsnapshot</code> and the process is really quite simple.  First, install <code>rsnapshot</code>; if you&rsquo;re using a system with a <a href="http://www.debian.org">good</a> <a href="http://www.ubuntu.org">package</a> <a href="http://www.freebsd.org">manager</a>, then this is a trivial operation:</p>

<pre>
~$ sudo aptitude install rsnapshot
</pre>

<p>Next, you must edit the <code>rsnapshot.conf</code> file which, in most Linux distributions, resides in <code>/etc</code>.  Note that the key/value pairs in this file must be <b>tab</b> delimited.  The file is well commented; the major things that need to be changed are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>snapshot_root</code> - where the backups will be stored</li>
<li>backup intervals - how many of each interval to keep around (I do 7 dailys, 4 weeklys and 3 monthlys)</li>
<li>backup points - what to backup</li>
</ul>

<p>The last point requires some elaboration, as this is what <code>rsnapshot</code> will be backing up.  for a server that is only backing up it&rsquo;s own stuff this can be fairly simple:</p>

<pre>
backup    /etc/            servername/
backup    /var/lib/svn/    servername/
backup    /home/           servername/
</pre>

<p>Which tells <code>rsnapshot</code> to backup <code>/etc</code>, <code>/home</code> and the subversion repository and place them in the directory <code>servername</code> under the <code>snapshot_root</code> directory.  <code>rsnapshot</code> is also capable of backup up remote hosts via ssh:</p>

<pre>
backup    root@remote:/etc/     remote/     +rsync_long_args=--bwlimit=120
backup    root@remote:/home/    remote/     +rsync_long_args=--bwlimit=120
</pre>

<p>As above, this will backup the contents of the specified directories under the <code>remote_host</code> directory in your <code>snapshot_root</code> directory.  This also gives an example of passing arguments to <code>rsync</code> for that host.  I use this to backup my home machine to my server; since I&rsquo;m on a residential internet link, I tell <code>rsync</code> to limit its bandwidth usage to 120 kilobytes per second when it is backing up this host to keep from saturating the pipe.</p>

    <div class="article-title-date">Oct 29, 2007</div>
    <p>My dad made up a bunch of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulce_de_leche">dulce de leche</a> a while back; if you&rsquo;re going to boil one can, you might as well fill the pot.  For those who don&rsquo;t know, the easiest way to make dulce de leche, a caramelized milk product popular in South and Central America, is to boil a can of <em>sweetened</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_milk">condensed milk</a> for two to three hours.  At the shorter end of that range, you&rsquo;ll end up with viscosity similar to a caramel syrup; longer and it turns into a thick, spreadable paste, not unlike Nutella.</p>

<p>I have seen numerous references on the internet of people not wanting to boil a can for fear of it exploding, but this trepidation is unfounded - boiling is a normal part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canning">canning</a> process.  The contents of the can are put in, the can is sealed and then it is brought to 100&#xB0;C or even hotter to sterilize the elements within.  Leaving a can in boiling water on the stove is perfectly safe, assuming the pan doesn&rsquo;t run dry, the water will keep the system, can included, from breaking the boiling point.  That&rsquo;s just basic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics">thermodynamics</a>.  As mentioned previously, it&rsquo;s worthwhile to boil a few cans at once, since the energy expenditure of keeping a pot simmering on the stove is nearly identical.</p>

<p>To make the ice cream, combine these ingredients and toss it into your ice cream maker:</p>

<pre>
1 can sweetened condensed milk
1 can dulce de leche
1 cup heavy cream
2 cups milk
Vanilla to taste (1-3 teaspoons)
</pre>

<p>I used thick (3 hour) dulce de leche, which lends a very strong flavor and skim milk, because it was in the fridge.  To get everything to combine, I had to stir it on the stove for about 10 minutes.  Don&rsquo;t just let milk sit on the stove unstirred, however; it grows a nasty skin quite quickly.  If you don&rsquo;t have another can of sweetened condensed milk, it can be replaced by another cup of cream, a half cup of milk and a cup of sugar.</p>
