Undoubtedly, the most comprehensive map to electronic music is [Ishkur's Guide](http://www.di.fm/edmguide/edmguide.html) which covers every genre, even reaching out to Rap, much of which contains electronic elements.  Ishkur's Guide is certainly worth perusing if you're interested in electronic music, but is a bit cumbersome for someone simply looking for an overview.  The best way to get a quick understanding of the different genres within electronic music is to hear the same song presented through different interpretations.  Madonna's [<em>Like a Prayer</em>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_a_Prayer_%28song%29) fits this bill nicely, as it has been remixed by numerous artists in a myriad of styles.

[The original](http://dinomite.net/static/music/madonna-like-a-prayer-original.mp3) version of the song is a pop-styled electronic-backed vocal ensemble with a number of distinct elements.  Taking note of the song's components is important to understanding which parts the remixes keep, which they alter and what from the song is tossed out completely.  The archetype begins with an odd riff from a guitar that isn't heard anywhere else in the song, nor in any remixes; such introductions are often thrown to the wayside when songs are remixed.  From there, the song progresses with an ethereal chorus backing Madonna's airy and LOVING vocals which sets the mood.  From there, the an 80's electric bass and drum set are added, which come and go throughout the balance of the tune.  As you will hear in the remixes all of the elements of the song will be subject to change.

First is a version by [Mad'House](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad'House), a short-lived ensemble which <em>only</em> made remixes of Madonna songs.  I would describe this mix as having a [house](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_music) feel, which is certainly in keeping the the group's intentions.  It adds a harder base beat, electronic bass kicks and replaces Madonna's vocals with those of Buse ÃœnlÃ¼, the group's vocalist.  This track keeps true to the feeling of the original, while forgoing the instrumentation in pop princess' version entirely.

Break out your subwoofer, because the club mix is here.  Club music is, hence the name, intended for dance clubs, which accounts for the overpowering bass kick.  Beyond Mad'House's mix, this track brings the aforementioned bass beat, more heavily altered vocals and transforms the choir to make them sound much more anthem-esque.  Club mixes are all about big sounds in a vain attempt to keep from being drowned out in the hustle of late-night dancing and in doing so, share the self righteousness that Anthem Trance (see Ishkur's guide) is known for; all tension and power without any release.

</ul>
[HI-NRG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-NRG) is the music of raver kiddies.  If you've ever seen the movie <em>[Go](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%281999_film%29)</em>, you know what raves are about.  Lots of drugs, [ecstacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylenedioxymethamphetamine) in particular, sex and dancing...all..night...long.  The dancing, not the sex.  Really.  Only when rolling would one feel the need to dance to such fast-paced music for 10 hours straight.  150 beats per minute is the minimum here, folks.  A continuous rising and falling ethereal piano is a staple of HI-NRG, as are the high-pitched vocals replacing the calmer and more subdued singing of Madonna.  [Anabolic Frolic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolic_Frolic)'s Happy2bHardcore series of mix albums is characteristic of the genre.

</ul>
150 beats per minute, no less.  Deafening bass beats, chipmunk vocals and hard charging melodies.  These are the tenets of [gabber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabber).  The original song?  Yeah, it's in there somewhere, represented in the tings, thumps and industrial sounds pervasive within the gabber genre.  When someone who doesn't enjoy electronic music (or, more often, thinks they won't like it) describes "techno," this is what a sketch artist would build from their description.  In reality, however, gabber is on the fringe of the electronic genre, the bastard child of [industrial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_music) and HI-NRG.

You probably wouldn't have guessed that someone could make <em>Like a Prayer</em> sound evil and depressing, but here it is.  Replace the vocals with those of an angsty adolescent, simplify the beats down to electronic drum hits, replace the melody with a spartan version from a machine and you've got yourself [darkcore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkcore).
