While reading the [Wikipeidia](http://en.wikipedia.org) page on [adhesive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive) I came across this nugget of wisdom on food decomposition:

<blockquote>Another example is when someone tries to pull apart Oreo cookies and all the filling remains on one side. The goal in this case is an adhesive failure, rather than a cohesive failure.</blockquote>

Apparently, when you're trying to break apart an [Oreo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oreo) and get all the filling to stay on one side, say, to make a quad-stuf (yep, [only one 'f'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oreo#Varieties)) Oreo, you are hoping for an adhesive or interfacial failure, that is, a failure of the adhesive (white, corn-syrupy goodness) where it meets the adherent (black cookie piece).

Also, for another barely-related angle is [this page](http://massmma.net/readMore.php?id=245) from a UFC forum discussing the caloric content of foods someone mentions their method of making Oreos less bad for you:

<blockquote>i just want everyone to know this lil diet trick i use to cut calories out of my double stuff oreos, if you take 2 of them apart and make 1 quad stuff oreo you eliminate 2 of the chocholat cookies there for cutting out calories while you enjoy a nice diet quad stuff oreo</blockquote>

Though I'd say the perfect ratio of filling to cookie is somewhere between 2 and 3 to one, I often make quad-stuf monsters.
