There are a [number](http://nomnompaleo.com/post/3397688384/curried-beef-broccoli-slaw-mushroom-frittata) of [recipes](http://www.norcalsc.com/index.php/post/egg_cupcakes_to_go/) for [paleo](http://everydaypaleo.com/2010/03/24/egg-cupcakes/) [muffins](http://paleoblocks.blogspot.com/2010/08/breakfast-muffins.html), which are a great way to get fast [paleo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet) food in the morning.  As I usually do with cooking, I created my own recipe from the ones I found online.  For 24 muffins, I assembled:

 - 18 eggs
 - 5 small sausages (breakfast size)
 - 2 large sausages
 - 1 red pepper
 - 1 large onion
 - 1/2 cup strained yogurt (Greek style)

The odd sausage arrangement is simply because that is what I had on hand--once cooked and crumbled it was about 2 &frac12; cups worth of sausage.

I began by cooking the sausage, followed by sautÃ©ing the diced onion & pepper in the fat that rendered out of the sausage.  After cracking all of the eggs into a a large bowl, I whisked them together with the yogurt.  With all of that assembled, I combined the sausage with the pepper & onion and portioned it into a pair of muffin pans.  The eggs are the last thing before the oven, filling each cup &#8532;rds full.  Into the oven for 15 minutes, rotate top/bottom pan, and give them another 7-10.  The bottoms of mine were a bit under cooked, so I might try putting the lower rack all the way down, rather than the standard in-the-middle.
