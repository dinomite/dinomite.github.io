[Representative Marsha Blackburn ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsha_Blackburn) (R, TN) made the most blatant invocation of patriotism as a scare tactic that I've ever heard in the debate over the non-binding resolution to condemn President Bush's troop surge.

<blockquote>
Rep. Blackburn: I think the question we have to ask is who's side are you on?  Who's side are you on?  Are you on the side of freedom?  Are you on the side of allowing the terrorists to get an upper hand?
</blockquote>

Wow, could you be more of a fear monger?  Remember, if you don't support a war in which thousands of American soldiers have died, countless more (really, find the statistics) have been maimed and costs us billions each year, then you're on the side of the terrorists.
