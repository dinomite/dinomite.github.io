I just finish reading Sam Harris' <em>Letter to a Christian Nation</em>, which is a very good book.  At one point he notes that the bible stipulates [Pi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi) is exactly 3.  I wondered how such a book would lay out mathematical constants, but it's pretty straightforward:

<blockquote>
The sea was then cast; it was made with a circular rim, and measured ten cubits across, five in height, and thirty in circumference.
Under the brim, gourds encircled it, ten to the cubit all the way around; the gourds were in two rows and were cast in one mold with the sea.
</blockquote>
Kings 7:23-24

<blockquote>
He also made the molten sea. It was perfectly round, ten cubits in diameter, five in depth, and thirty in circumference
</blockquote>
II Chronicles 4:2

I must say that it's a weak argument, because they could be simply approximations by an observer, but it's funny nonetheless.
