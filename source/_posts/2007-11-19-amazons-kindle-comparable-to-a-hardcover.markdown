Morgan Webb made a comparison between Amazon's new [Kindle](http://amazon.com/gp/product/B000FI73MA/sr=53-1/qid=1195527445/ref=tr_359161) eBook reader and a hardcover book.  Though she was simply trying to liken the Kindle to the nearest priced physical book product, this is a false comparison.  Someone buying a hardcover book is looking for something more than just the words and content of the story; they enjoy the physical representation of a fine work.  A more accurate comparison for the Kindle is a regular old paperback, whose purchaser is simply looking for the cheapest representation of the book's content.  At less than $15 for the average paperback, the Kindle doesn't look like such a good deal, since they charge $10 per book for the $400 device.
