This is the synopsis of [Off The Hook](http://www.2600.com/offthehook) that aired on [27 February 2008](http://www.2600.com/offthehook/2008/0208.html).

In the studio: Emmanuel, Mike, Redbird, Not Kevin, Lazlo<br />
On the phone: Bernie S in Philadelphia, Bill Pollack from [No Starch Press](http://nostarch.com/)<br />
Via Skype: Jon Erickson, author of Hacking: The Art of Exploitation

The last week of fundraising.

Emmanuel plays a clip from 30 November 1999 where Amy Goodman was covering the [WTO protests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO_Ministerial_Conference_of_1999_protest_activity) in Seattle, which he cites as the beginning of the independent media movement on the internet.  He relates a story of Shapeshifter, 2600's layout artist, who was arrested in Philadelphia after police saw him talking on a cell phone and accused him of organizing the protests.  Shapeshifter later won a suit against the city for wrongful arrest, since his using a telephone was the limit of their evidence.
