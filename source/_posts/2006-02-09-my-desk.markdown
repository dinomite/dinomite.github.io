This probably isn't that interesting, but I'll may find it good to look back on at some point.  A simple picture of my desk while I'm working on a project on the laptop and the right screen (I just got the LCD for Christmas); you can also see the massive queue of books I needed to get through at that time.  That little plastic shelf almost broke.
