Best known for their eponymous debut album, [Dune](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(German_band)) is a mid-90's techno outfit whose music incorporates many of the styles endemic to [House](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_music) and [Dance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_dance_music) at the time.  **Expedicion** is a good exploration of the style, featuring lots of fast beats throughout, a bit singing vocals and even some good-old meaningless talking throughout some tracks.  The entire album is also sprinkled with radio recordings including the classic NASA piece, "we're go for auto-sequence start" on the opening track *Rising*.

The album opens with my favorite track, *Million Miles from Home* which incorporates some speedy [808](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TR-909) beats, broken by slow and emotive sections and all with a melodic vocal loop.  The track *In My Dreams* has a very [IDM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_dance_music)/[drum and bass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_dance_music) style to it and is topped off by vocals that are a bit more odd, but appropriate.  *In The Air*, which is split into two disparate tracks, lends a somewhat trancey feel with it's lower tempo and slower progression.  The balance of the album, including *Hand in Hand*, *Rainbow to the Stars* and *Around the World* are almost [Happy Hardcore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Hardcore) anthems, save for their just-a-bit-too-slow tempos.
