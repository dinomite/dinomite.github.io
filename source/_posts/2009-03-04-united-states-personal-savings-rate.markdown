Americans aren't good at saving money.  The average amount of disposable income â€” income less taxes, not to be confused with [discretionary income](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_income) â€” saved has dropped from 11% in the 1980s to 1% before the start of the current recession.  A graph is appropriate here:

I'm not some anti-materialist nazi, but that downward march is the increased confusion that Americans have between "wants" and "needs".  Sure, [real wages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_wage) [have decreased](http://www.workinglife.org/wiki/Wages+and+Benefits%3A+Real+Wages+%281964-2004%29)  over this time period, but not nearly at the rate that savings has slumped.

The uptick for 2009?  That's the just-released data for January of this year which pegs the rate at 5%, up from 1.8% in 2008 and 0.5% the previous year.  August of 2005 even featured a rate of <strong>negative</strong> 2.7%, a feat matched only by the -0.2% rate in 2001.  Though I would generally argue that people thinking about their future rather than [instant gratification](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/business/09view.html?ex=1362718800&en=e0525c458b2d83df&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink) is a wonderful change, increased saving isn't what an economy needs to break out of a recession.
