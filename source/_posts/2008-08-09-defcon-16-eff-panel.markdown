Much of the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](http://www.eff.org)'s talk at DEFCON 16 concerned the temporary injunction that prevented [MIT students](http://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-16/dc-16-speakers.html#Anderson) from giving a talk on vulnerabilities of the [MBTA](http://www.mbta.com) farecard system.  The injunction seems to say taht the only people prevented from disseminating the information about the system are the MIT students themselves and any cohorts in their research.  One question that I head was which other systems may be vulnerable to the same RFID card attack and here's the list from their slides:

- Boston
- London
- Netherlands
- Minneapolis
- South Korea
- Hong Kong
- Beijing
- Madrid
- Rio de Janeiro
- New Dehli
- Bangkok

More information is provided in [their slides](http://dinomite.net/wp-content/uploads/defcon-16-anderson-ryan-cheisa.pdf).
