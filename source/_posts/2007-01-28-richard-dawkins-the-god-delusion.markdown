I just picked up <strong>The God Delusion</strong> by Richard Dawkins, a book which I'm sure contains numerous interesting quotes.  The first chapter focuses on the undue respect afforded to religious beliefs.  Dawkins makes the point that, though people can openly argue about politics, economics and warfare, religion gets a pass.  Arguing about religion is a way to bring up undue hatred from anyone whose views differ.  In concluding the chapter he quotes [H. L. Mencken](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._L._Mencken) who said, "We must respect the other fellow's religion, but only in the sense and to the extent that we respect his theory that his wife is beautiful and his children smart."  A fitting summarization.
