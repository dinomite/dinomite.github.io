Wikipedia has an amazingly large and varied database of information, including numerous lists, such as a [list of ridiculous highway intersections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malfunction_Junction).  There are some really screwed up intersections shown on that page most notably [I-40 meeting I-295 in Knoxville](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Knoxville+TN&ll=35.968559,-83.928831&spn=0.007086,0.017231&t=h),    [I-96 with highway 39 in Detroit](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Detroit+MI&ll=42.378733,-83.216962&spn=0.003448,0.007328&t=h),  and the local-to-me [Springfield Mixing Bowl](http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&lr=lang_en&om=1&z=15&ll=38.784197,-77.172303&spn=0.027632,0.066133&t=h).  None of these intersections, however, can shake a stick at Swindon's [Magic Roundabout](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Roundabout_%28Swindon%29) which is a single large central roundabout with 5 feeder roundabouts.
