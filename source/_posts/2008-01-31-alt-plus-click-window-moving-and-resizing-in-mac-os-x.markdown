Anyone who has used X Windows enough, has certainly experienced the wondrous ability to move windows with alt + left click and resize them with alt + right click.  I quickly missed this ability after switching from a Linux machine at home to one running Mac OS X.  Luckily, like every small annoyance in Aqua, this one can be fixed with a small utility called [Zooom](http://coderage-software.com/zooom/demos/demos.html), which allows you to set key bindings for resizing and moving windows.  Additionally, Zooom can provide magnetism to screen edges and the menu bar.  It's free for 30 days and then $15.
