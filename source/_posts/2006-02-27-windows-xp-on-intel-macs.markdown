About a month ago a guy [started a site](http://windowsxp.onmac.net/The%20Contest.html) to collect donations and build a pool of money that would be given to the first person to get Windows XP runing on the new Intel-based Macs.  In the intervening time, some development progress has been made but overall it's been quite slow.  The hold up is that Windows has forever been designed to run on a machine with a standard BIOS that was designed way back when...  Basically, the Intel Macs initiate the boot process in a wholly different manner than all x86 PCs have previously.  This different booting strategy has been the real holdup in getting Windows to run on the otherwise fairly standard hardware and it looks like last week someone [got past that hurdle](http://windows.onmac.net/2006/02/21/the-windows-installer-loaded-on-an-imac/), booting into the Windows installer.  With that, I'd say we're nearing the time when Windows will run on Macs, a glorious day indeed.
